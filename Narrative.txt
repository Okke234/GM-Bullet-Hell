Abducted. The player has been captured a mysterious psychopath who likes to call himself 'The Puppet Master'. The player is told they're allowed to regain their freedom should they be able to complete all levels within the target times set by The Puppet Master himself. As the player isn't the only person to face this challenge, The Puppet Master has also decided there will be competition among the players. The fastest player per level will be handsomely rewarded.
